This Flask application serves as both a JWT authentication server and a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) provider. It generates RSA keys upon initialization, stores them in a SQLite database, and uses these keys to sign JWTs. The application supports generating both valid and expired JWTs based on client requests and provides a JWKS endpoint for clients to retrieve public keys for JWT validation.
